            <h2>Air India merger: What you need to know about Tata Groupâ€™s big aviation deal</h2>
            <p>The merged entity is anticipated to evolve into a powerful player in the Indian aviation scene, boasting
                a
                combined
                fleet of nearly 140 aircraft. If all goes as planned and the necessary regulatory approvals are secured,
                the
                merger is
                expected to be completed by April 2024.
                As the prospective Vistara-Air India merger approaches its final regulatory stages, Vistara's CEO, Vinod
                Kannan,
                confirmed on Monday that discussions have commenced regarding the integration of personnel across the
                two
                Tata Group
                carriers. While Kannan assured no significant staff cuts at Vistara due to the merger, he noted that
                role
                changes are
                likely, given the repositioning process that usually accompanies such consolidations.
                Air India is concurrently working on unifying different sectors of its workforce, gearing up for a
                phased
                integration
                involving its own long-standing and newly joined employees, and subsequently, those from Vistara and
                AirAsia
                (India).</p>
            <h3>Key players in the Vistara-Air India merger</h3>
            <p>The merger aims to give birth to a robust aviation powerhouse that can snag a larger piece of the pie in
                India's
                expanding domestic flyers segment. By blending the strengths of both Vistara and Air India, the unified
                entity aims to
                turn the tide in its favour against rival market players, especially IndiGo. Post-merger, Singapore
                Airlines
                is slated
                to own a significant 25.1 per cent stake in the newly formed entity.</p>
